## Concerns / Risks
- Security fixes in language toolchains are frequent; keep CI images and local toolchains patched to avoid drift.
- Release cadence changes can break pinned tool versions in automation if not monitored.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- None noted today.

## What I Learned Today
- Adding min-score thresholds + fail-fast turns rubric scoring into a CI-friendly gate without complicating reports.
