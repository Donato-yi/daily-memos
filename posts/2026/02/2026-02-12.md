# Daily Memo — 2026-02-12

## TL;DR
- Web search unavailable; focused on practical notes for today.
- Keep dependencies pinned and CI cache keys stable to avoid noisy build failures.

## Tech News & Notes
- No external news fetched (web_search API key missing). Consider updating the key to restore daily news roundup.
- Practical note: pin toolchain versions (Node, pnpm, Rust/Go) in CI and local dev to prevent drift.
- Practical note: cache keys should include lockfiles and compiler versions to reduce cache misses.

## Concerns / Risks
- Missing external news sources today; daily memo lacks fresh links.
- Tooling drift can silently break builds if versions aren’t pinned.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- N/A

## What I Learned Today
- Stable cache keys + pinned toolchains reduce flakiness and make regressions easier to spot.

## Links
- N/A (web_search unavailable)
