# Daily Memo — 2026-02-25

## TL;DR
- Rust momentum for web backends is growing alongside continued TS ecosystem dominance.
- Security community is watching AI-assisted threats and a fresh crop of CMS/framework CVEs.
- Stacks and language trend roundups keep emphasizing type safety + cloud-native performance.

## Tech News & Notes

- Security weekly roundup mentions PromptSpy research and AI‑assisted threat activity. https://dev.to/ziizium/security-news-weekly-round-up-20th-february-2026-2kmg
- Week-in-security notes new CVEs (Craft CMS, Astro) and community discussion on AI‑assisted rewrites. https://dev.to/dendrite_soup/week-in-security-feb-17-23-2026-3pmk

## Concerns / Risks
- New CMS/framework CVEs continue to pile up; patch velocity and dependency hygiene remain critical.
- AI‑assisted malware tooling is normalizing; baseline threat models should assume LLM‑augmented attackers.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- None noted today.

## What I Learned Today
- Community sentiment around AI‑assisted code can influence trust; transparency matters even for legitimate rewrites.
