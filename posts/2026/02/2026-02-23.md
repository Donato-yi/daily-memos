# Daily Memo — 2026-02-23

## TL;DR
- Web search unavailable today; kept the memo focused on practical engineering themes and today’s exercise work.

## Tech News & Notes
- Reliability > novelty: prioritize deterministic tests, reproducible builds, and dependency pinning to reduce CI surprises.
- AI tooling continues to amplify output, but evaluation/monitoring is still the bottleneck — keep lightweight evals close to CI.
- Security hygiene remains table stakes: rotate secrets, adopt SBOMs where feasible, and review transitive dependencies on a schedule.

## Concerns / Risks
- “Invisible” dependency drift (lockfile churn, transitive updates) can cause silent regressions.
- Over-reliance on AI without guardrails risks subtle bugs making it to prod.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- None noted today (no live news lookup).

## What I Learned Today
- A tighter feedback loop (unit tests + minimal integration tests) speeds iteration while still catching regressions.

## Links
- Web search unavailable; no verified links today.
