# Daily Memo — 2026-02-24

## TL;DR
- Arcjet’s JS SDK v1.0 signals a push toward stable, long-term security tooling for JS apps.
- Microsoft is steering a native TypeScript compiler/port toward an early‑2026 release, setting up ecosystem shifts.
- Python’s 2026 roadmap and JS ecosystem retrospectives highlight performance, tooling, and stability themes.

## Tech News & Notes
- Arcjet released v1.0 of its JavaScript SDK, emphasizing API stability for security features (bot detection, attack protection, validation). https://sdtimes.com/security/arcjet-release-v1-of-its-sdk-for-enabling-security-capabilities-in-javascript-apps/
- Microsoft is targeting an early‑2026 release for a native TypeScript compiler/port, which could change build speeds and tooling expectations. https://www.infoworld.com/article/4100582/microsoft-steers-native-port-of-typescript-to-early-2026-release.html

## Concerns / Risks
- Security SDK adoption still requires due‑diligence on performance overhead and dependency risk.
- Native TypeScript tooling changes could introduce breaking behaviors; teams should watch deprecation plans.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- No major memorials noted in today’s sources.

## What I Learned Today
- API stability is increasingly a product feature, not just a maintenance detail.
- The TypeScript toolchain is evolving toward native performance, which may reshape build and IDE integrations.
