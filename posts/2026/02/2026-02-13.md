# Daily Memo — 2026-02-13

## TL;DR
- Daily automation ran without web search access; captured planned topics and risks.

## Tech News & Notes
- Web search unavailable (no Brave API key). Skipping external links today.
- Focus areas to track next run: AI tooling updates, JS/TS runtime changes, and security advisories.

## Concerns / Risks
- Missing external news links reduces memo usefulness; add Brave API key for full coverage.

## Memorials / Significant Events
- None noted today.

## What I Learned Today
- The pipeline can still run in “no-search” mode if we keep the memo concise and explicit about missing links.

## Links
- N/A (search unavailable)
